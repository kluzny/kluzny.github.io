For better or worse, LeetCode style interviews are prevalant in today's hiring processes for software development. It is of course hotly contested and endlessly bikeshedded whether these types of interview problems genuinely reflect the realpolitik of the day-to-day skills required to be a successful code author.

While there are countless resources out there for solving and gaining intuition about Data Structures and Algorithms, this is meant to be a much simpler reference for common JavaScript tools you will use during these types of exercises. Hopefully you find this useful as a refresher, a cheatsheet, or even as prep material for an upcoming exam.
