Below is the most recent publically available image of your location from outer space. Graciously provided by NASA via Landsat 8.  Your location is estimated using your IP address from [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io)

Note: This image is not real-time, and is often captured at night and obscured by clouds. This is an artifact of how difficult it is to go to space and take pictures.
