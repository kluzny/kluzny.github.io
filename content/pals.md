## (P)ersonal (A)rtificial (L)ife (S)imulation

Here is a silly desktop pal made in [godot](https://godotengine.org).

I know what you are thinking, "kyle, this is not a desktop" and you would be correct,
but this is just a [web version](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_web.html)
(with most capabilities retained)

## Features

* Unix time support
* Moods
* Scoring
* Survival Mechanics
* Tossable
* Vaporwave Holodeck Menu
* Bonk!

## Desktop Version

I hope to have a desktop version available soon, along with the source code and assets. For technical reasons, not all functionality is avialable via the browser `:(`

* Transparent window to see your desktop
* Mouse Passthrough to interact with your desktop and maintain focus.
