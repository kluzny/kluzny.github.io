## In Progress

### Foundation Trilogy - Isaac Asimov - 1951

I'm  currently reading the 'second' of 3 books, in the published order, not in-universe chronological order. Despite being nearly 75 years old at this review, they show no signs of its age. This is probably due to the far-future setting, and how the fiction isn't driven by the technology. The technology forms a substrate and curiously, most of the action of the books happens off-page.

What I love most about this collection is the sprawling scope of galactic scale. We get to watch several galaxy-wide empires rise and fall over the course of several centries. The story also feels a bit like a chase, as told in several short stories from the perspective of a dozen or more main characters. I find myself picking it up every evening chasing the next adventurer across the galaxy and asking where in the cosmos will I pickup this great pursuit next.

## Science Fiction

I love me some Science Fiction. There is nothing quite like exploring humanity through the lenses of the past, the present, and especially the future.
