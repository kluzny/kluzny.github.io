## In Progress

#### Foundation Trilogy - Isaac Asimov - 1951

I'm currently reading the 'second' of 3 books, in the published order, not in-universe chronological order. Despite being nearly 75 years old at the time of this review, they show no signs of its age. This is probably due to the far-future setting, and how the fiction isn't driven by the technology. The technology forms a backdrop of an advanced society and is almost never central to the plot. Curiously, most of the action of the books happens off-page, leaving much to the reader's imagination, but not so much as to be left wanting.

What I love most about this collection is the sprawling scope of galactic scale. We get to watch several galaxy-wide empires rise and fall over the course of several centries. The story also feels a bit like a chase, as told in several short stories from the perspectives of a dozen or more main characters, always in the shadow of the almost mythical, very nearly religious, future predicting statitician Hari Seldon. I find myself picking it up every evening, chasing the next adventurer across the galaxy and asking where in the cosmos will this great pursuit take me next.

## Science Fiction

I love me some Science Fiction. There is nothing quite like exploring humanity through the lenses of the past, the present, and most intriguingly, the future. It isn't only the sonic screwdrivers and the warp cores that draw my interest, but using encounters we haven't seen, or sometimes even yet imagined, to examine our modern values in a vast cosmos.

### Books

### Novella

#### Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde - Robert Louis Stevenson - 1886

Allegedly, this story was written in under a week! Many would call this a gothic horror, but I cheekily sneak it under science fiction by virtue of the role of chemistry and life sciences in the grand transmogrification. I had to look up quite a few archaic words in this reading, but otherwise only took an afternoon. Still a timeless tale of the beasts that reside in all men and the nature of good and evil. While the story over time has been watered down so strongly that it can be portrayed by the likes of Bugs Bunny, I would say this is for an older teen to adult audience, as it features themes of murder, addiction, identity and sexuality.

### Short Fiction

#### Harrison Bergeron - Kurt Vonnegut Jr. 1961

[PDF via archive.org](https://ia801400.us.archive.org/30/items/HarrisonBergeron/Harrison%20Bergeron.pdf) [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron) [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10176119-harrison-bergeron)

A sort of tongue in cheek dystopia where mediocrity becomes the goal of society, rather than excellence. It's funnier when read as a treatise on why you shouldn't distract your engineers with random meetings.

An short and interesting read, but feels like it could be used as a bludgeon for those who don't draw a distinction between equality and equity. It may have made more sense socially when it was written, but today seems to falls a bit flat, as extreme equality is only a threat to straw and boogey men in a world that is more unequal than ever.
