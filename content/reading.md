## In Progress

### Foundation Trilogy - Isaac Asimov - 1951

[PDF via Archive.org](https://dn790006.ca.archive.org/0/items/AsimovTheFoundation/Asimov_the_foundation.pdf) [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(novel_series)) [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43939-foundation-chronological-order)

I'm  currently reading the 'second' of 3 books, in the published order, not in-universe chronological order. Despite being nearly 75 years old at the time of this review, they show no signs of its age. This is probably due to the far-future setting, and how the fiction isn't driven by the technology. The technology forms a backdrop of an advanced society and is almost never central to the plot. Curiously, most of the action of the books happens off-page, leaving much to the reader's imagination, but not so much as to be left wanting.

What I love most about this collection is the sprawling scope of galactic scale. We get to watch several galaxy-wide empires rise and fall over the course of several centries. The story also feels a bit like a chase, as told in several short stories from the perspectives of a dozen or more main characters, always in the shadow of the almost mythical, very nearly religious, future predicting statitician Hari Seldon. I find myself picking it up every evening, chasing the next adventurer across the galaxy and asking where in the cosmos will this great pursuit take me next.


## Science Fiction

I love me some Science Fiction. There is nothing quite like exploring humanity through the lenses of the past, the present, and most intriguingly, the future. It isn't only the sonic screwdrivers and the warp cores that draw my interest, but using encounters we haven't seen, or sometimes even yet imagined, to examine our modern values in a vast cosmos.
