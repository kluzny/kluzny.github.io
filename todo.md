## Bugs

* Because RecentPosts is using the content queryCollection, manual posts ( like hello world ) do not show up in the recent posts list. It's unclear if if its better to just double down on making md content ( with their hacky component embedding ) to hack together something to allow for mixed content types in RecentPosts.
